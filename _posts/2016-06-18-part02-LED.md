In this exercise we will build a circuit with an LED. Then, we will make it blink.

#### Build the Circuit

0. Power the circuit from the arduino.
    * Place a wire from pin 13 on the arduino to a row on the breadboard.
    * Place a wire from the GND pin on the arduino to  a different row on the breadboard.
    * Your circuit should look like this.

0. Include an LED in the circuit
    * Look at your LED. Observe that one leg is longer than the other. The long leg is the positive side.
    * Place the positive leg of the LED in the same row as the pin 13 wire from the arduino.
    * Use the resistor to connect the GND from the arduino and the short leg of the LED.
    * Your circuit should look like this.

#### Flash the Light

0. Make sure your code for blinking the LED is open in the arduino IDE.
0. Make sure your arduino is plugged into your computer.
0. Run the code.
0. Watch the light blink.
