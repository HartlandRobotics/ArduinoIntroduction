Some tools and supplies that will be useful for constructing and
customizing your robot.

# Screwdrivers
We have lots of phillips and flathead screwdrivers of all sizes, though we don't have enough for everyone to keep for the entire time.  Please make sure to return them when you are done.

## Scisors and Exacto Knives
Want to cover up the electronic components of your robot? Make a shell
out of some Foam Board. Then make it awesome

## Foam Board
Foam board is great for prototyping.  It is relatively strong, and easy to cut. This is a great start for a robot shell.

## Glue, Tape, Staples, Velcro, Magnets, Zip Ties
Zip ties are the magic that you will find in robots of all sizes. They
are magical.
