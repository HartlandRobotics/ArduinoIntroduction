In this exercise we will find out how far an object is from our circuit.

#### Open the Arduino IDE

Instead of using a built in sample, we are going to create our own. Navigate the menu to create a new file.

0. File
0. New

Rename the file to something more meaningful than sketch. We suggest using distanceSensor.

0. File
0. Save as
0. Change the file name to distanceSensor

**Distance Sensor Code:**
Once you have the blank file, update your IDE to contain the following code.

#### Plug in the Arduino

0. Attach the USB cable to the computer
0. Attach the USB cable to the Arduino.
  * Be careful attaching this end. Make sure it is right side up and do not force the connection
0. Press the Verify button in the Arduino IDE (it looks like a checkmark)
0. Press the Download button in the Arduino IDE (it looks like an arrow facing right)
0. The Arduino will indicate that it is updating
0. Your code will execute blinking a single LED that is built into the Arduino board
