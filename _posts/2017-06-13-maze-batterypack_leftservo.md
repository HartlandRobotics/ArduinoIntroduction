#### Battery Pack

Take a look at your battery pack.
* Locate the side opposite the on/off switch. This side will attach to the robot.
* Make sure the switch is in the off position
* Slide open the battery pack and insert the batteries.
* Close the pack back up and attach it to the chassis. Make sure the wires are facing the rear of the robot when you attach them.
* Route the wires through one of the two holes in the chassis
 
* 

The first step in building your robot is to understand the orientation of the chassis.

* The edge of the chassis that is tapered is the front of the robot.
* The edge of the chassis that has two notches is the rear of the robot.
* Once you have the front and rear positioned correctly, the hole near the front of the robot should be offset to the left. You might have to flip over the chassis to get the orientation correct.

Set the chassis in front of you so that it looks like this:

#### Attach the Arduino

* Locate the Arduino in your kit.
* Turn the Arduino so that the power and USB ports are facing the rear of the robot.
* Attach the Arduino to the chassis making sure not to cover up any of the holes that will be used later.

#### Attach the Breadboard

* Locate the breadboard in your kit.
* Attach it next to the Arduino making sure not to cover up any of the holes in the chassis.
