#### Chassis Orientation

The first step in building your robot is to understand the orientation of the chassis.

* The edge of the chassis that is tapered is the front of the robot.
* The edge of the chassis that has less holes is the rear of the robot.

Set the chassis in front of you so that it looks like this:

#### Attach the Arduino

* Locate the Arduino in your kit.
* Turn the Arduino so that the power and USB ports are facing the rear of the robot.
* Attach the Arduino to the chassis making sure not to cover up any of the holes that will be used later.

#### Attach the Circuit Board

* Locate the circuit board in your kit.
* **Be careful inserting the circuit board so you do not bend any pins!**
* Attach it to the Arduino making sure that the pins line up correctly.
    * Note that one side of the circuit board has numbers (8, 9, 10, etc.)
    * These should line up with the exact same number on the arduino.
    * Similarly, the labels on the other side of the circuit board should match the arduino.
