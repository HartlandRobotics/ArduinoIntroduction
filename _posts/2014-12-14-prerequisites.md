### Arduino IDE

IDE is an acronym for Integrated Development Environment. Sounds pretty
impressive. All that really means is that it is the tool that we will
use to edit code files, download code to the robot, and monitor robot
status when it is plugged into the computer running the IDE.

The Arduino IDE can be downloaded from [the Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

There is a section there for installations on

* [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php?f=/arduino-1.6.9-windows.exe)
* [Windows without Admin priviliges](https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php?f=/arduino-1.6.9-windows.zip)
* [OSX 10.7"Lion" or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php?f=/arduino-1.6.9-macosx.zip)
* [Linux 32 bit](https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php?f=/arduino-1.6.9-linux32.tar.xz)
* [Linux 64 bit](https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php?f=/arduino-1.6.9-linux64.tar.xz)

Choose the correct one for the operationg system that your computer is
running. If you have questions, ask one of the helpful robotics team
members.
