In this exercise we will start working with motors, motor controllers,
and external power.

#### Open the Arduino IDE

Just like with the earlier excersies, we are going to create a new sketch for this activity. Navigate the menu to create a new file.

0. File
0. New

Rename the file to something more meaningful than sketch. We suggest using motor.

0. File
0. Save as
0. Change the file name to motor

**Motor Controller Code:**
Once you have the blank file, update your IDE to contain the following code.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/dennisburton/bbd3475cecb89a4903c333d6154172e4.js"></script>

#### Upload

0. Verify the new code
0. Upload the new code to the Arduino.

#### Build the Circuit

0. Connect the motor controller to the Arduino
   * Connect the A-1A pin on the controller to the pin 9 on the Arduino
   * Connect the A-1B pin on the controller to the pin 8 on the Arduino
   * Connect the two wires on the motor to the two Motor A posts on the controller
   * Make sure the power on your battery pack is off
   * Fill your battery pack with 4 AA batteries
   * Connect the battery pack wires to the controller. Make sure the red wire is on VCC and the Black wire is on GND
   * Your circuit should look (almost) like this.
