#### Left Servo

Next we will add our first drive servo. This will be the servo that powers the left wheel of the robot.

* Turn over the robot so that you can see the bottom of the chassis
    * Be careful not to crush the wires you attached from the battery pack to the circuit board while doing this
* Take a piece of double sided tape and place it in between the two zip tie access holes **making sure it is in the middle**

* Attach one of your servos on the side to your right.
    * Make sure that the access holes for zip ties are still open
    * Make sure the servo wires are facing the rear of the robot
    * Make sure the mounting brackets on the servo are lined up with the outside of the zip tie access holes

* Use one of your large zip ties to secure the servo to the chassis.
    * This zip ties will route through the access holes on both sides of the servo
    * Ask for assistance if you need help tightening this zip tie without causing damage
    * You may also trim off the excess zip tie with side cutters

* Route the servo wire through one of the large access holes.

* Turn over the robot so that you can see the top of the chassis
* Attach the servo wires to the circuit board on the pins labeled left
    * Make sure the ground wire (black) is closer to the back of the robot or the hartland
