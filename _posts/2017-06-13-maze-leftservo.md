#### Left Servo

Next we will add our first drive servo. This will be the servo that powers the left wheel of the robot.

* Turn over the robot so that you can see the bottom of the chassis
    * Be careful not to crush the wires you attached from the battery pack to the breadboard while doing this
* Attach one of your servos on the side to your right.
    * Make sure that the access holes for zip ties are still open
    * Make sure the servo wires are facing the rear of the robot
    * Make sure the mouting brackets on the servo are lined up with the outside of the chassis

* Use one of your large zip ties to secure the servo to the chassis.
    * This zip ties will route through the access hole in front of the servo and the notch behind it
    * Ask for assistance if you need help tightening this zip tie without causing damage
    * You may also trim off the excess zip tie with side cutters

* Route the servo wire through one of the large access holes.

* Turn over the robot so that you can see the top of the chassis
* Place one of the 3 wire header pins in the breadboard making sure it is not in the same row as your battery pack

* Attach the servo wire to to the header pins

* Locate 3 pin to pin wires in your kit
* Attach one wire in the same row as the black wire from the servo
* Place the other side of this wire in the same row as the black wire from the battery pack
* Attach one wire in the same row as the red wire from the servo
* Place the other side of this wire in the same row as the red wire from the battery pack
* Attach one wire in the same row as the white wire from the servo
* Place the other side of this wire in pin 9 on the arduino
