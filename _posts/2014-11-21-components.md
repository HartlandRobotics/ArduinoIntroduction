## Arduino 
![Arduino]({{site.baseurl }}/assets/boards/uno.JPG)

Arduino will be the microcontroller that will be controlling your robot.
These can be purchased on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/LANMU%C2%AE-Atmega328p-Atmega16u2-Version-Arduino/dp/B00SF28U7A?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01)

## LEDs

We will use LEDs to build our first simple circuit. LEDs are available
in many different colors to personalize your bot! The LEDs that we are
using came in a kit with some other fun parts. Available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Elego-Electronics-component-resistors-Potentiometer/dp/B01ERPXFZK?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00)

## Motors and Wheels

Motors and Wheels
There are many places to purchase these. For this workshop, we found
them on [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/4-Pcs-Smart-Car-Robot-Plastic-Tire-Tyre-Wheel-DC-6V-Gear-Motor-Set-for-Arduino-/231589909536) a bit cheaper.

## Ping (distance) Sensors
![Ping Sensor]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/components/ping.jpg)

Ping sensors can tell you how far away an object is.  They send out an ultrsonic pulse and measure the time it takes to receive the response.  These can be purchased on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Ultrasonic-Distance-Measuring-Compatible-Duemilanove/dp/B00SXZWMCS/ref=sr_1_1?rps=1&ie=UTF8&qid=1465054973&sr=8-1&keywords=HC-SR04&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011)

## Breadboards and Wires

![wires]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/components/wires.jpg)

The breadboard and wires are used to connect all of your components together with your Arduino. You can purchase a [Breadboard](http://www.amazon.com/Veewon-SYB-170-Color-Breadboard-Circuit/dp/B00OP4FQVU?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01) and [Wires](http://www.amazon.com/Kalevel%C2%AE-120pcs-Multicolored-Female-Breadboard/dp/B00M5WLZDW?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01) on Amazon

## Batteries

![AA]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/components/aa.jpg)
![AA clip]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/components/aa-clip.jpg)

Your kit includes four AA batteries.  Should you spend all the energy in your battery, we have some extra batteries for you to use.  We also have several 9V batteries and clips.


## Line Sensors
![Reflectance Array]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/components/reflectance.jpg)

These sensors work by bouncing light off of a surface and seeing how
much of the light was reflected back. This allows us to determine if the
surface under the sensor is light or dark.
This sensor can be purchased from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/C-J-Infrared-reflective-Photoelectr-TCRT5000/dp/B00XT0PBC0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1463438548&sr=8-2&keywords=tcrt5000)
