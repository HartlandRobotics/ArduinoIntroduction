Step 6: Thread 4x **Nuts** half way down each of the 4x **20mm Screws (silver)**.  
Step 7: Screw the 4x **20mm Screws (silver)** into the matching holes on the bottom of the **Middle Servo Plate**.  

- *Do not screw the **20mm Screws (silver)** in one at a time. Screw one part way, then proceed to the next, and so on.*
- *Stop when the screws are even with the top of the **Middle Servo Plate**. They should not stick out at all.*
