In this exercise we will find out our sensor can see something light or
dark.

#### Open the Arduino IDE

Just like with the distance sensor, we are going to create a new sketch for this activity. Navigate the menu to create a new file.

0. File
0. New

Rename the file to something more meaningful than sketch. We suggest using line.

0. File
0. Save as
0. Change the file name to line

**Line Sensor Code:**
Once you have the blank file, update your IDE to contain the following code.

#### Build the Circuit

0. Connect the line sensor to the Arduino
   * Connect the A0 pin on the sensor to the A5 pin on the Arduino
   * Connect the GND pin on the sensor to a GND pin on the Arduino
   * Connect the VCC pin on the sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduio
   * Your circuit should look like this.
