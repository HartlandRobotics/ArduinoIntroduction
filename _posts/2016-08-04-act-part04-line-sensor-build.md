It is now time to start constructing your robot!

First Layout your chassis and the line sensors

![LineSensorLayout]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/linefollower/c06-layout-line-sensors.jpg)

Attach two small pieces of double sided tape to the chassis where you
want to place he line sensors

Attach the line sensors to the tape. Make sure the lights are facing
down.

Attach voltage and ground from your breadboard to both line sensors

Attach the analog outputs from the line sensors to the Arduino. We are
using A5 for the right sensor and A4 for the left sensor.
