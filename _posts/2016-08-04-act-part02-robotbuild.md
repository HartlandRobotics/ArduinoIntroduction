It is now time to start constructing your robot!

First Layout your chassis, Arduino, and breadboard

![PartsLayout]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/linefollower/c01-layout-components.jpg)

Using a small piece of double sided tape, attach the Arduino to the
chassis.

![AttachArduino]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/linefollower/c02-attach-arduino.jpg)

Remove the cover from the adhisive on the breadboard.

![AttachBreadboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/linefollower/c03-attach-breadboard.jpg)

Attach the breadboard to the chassis.

![AttachedBreadboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/linefollower/c04-attached-breadboard.jpg)

Attach the distance sensor to the breadboard. The distance sensor will
plug into the breadboard the same way that we attached them in the
earlier lesson.

Attach the wires for the distance sensor. We set ours up to use pins 2
and 3 just like we did during the lesson the first time.
