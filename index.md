## Introduction to Robotics

Come join us and build your own robot. No really, your own robot! Not a robot from a kit, your robot. Customize your robot to be your own version of awesome. Work together with other builders to make your robots communicate with each other and show off just how cool robotics can be! You will learn some basic electronics, coding, and teamwork skills during this workshop.
